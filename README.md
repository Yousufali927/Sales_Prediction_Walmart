1. In this project, I have taken the analysis further using other methods, made predictions and debugged the code changing the deprecated functions to new functions, some example are :

      i.  The replacement of sns.distplot by sns.histplot. ( This function is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.)
     ii.  Further Store-wise Analysis of sales
    iii.  Further analysis using Heatmap, Seasonal analysis.
    iv.  Descriptive Analysis of code, to explain what each block of code does

2. Following installations will be required, Python 3.11.5 and mentioned libraries on your system, Jupiter notebook is preferred/recommended to run the code and for analysis. 
* Python 3.11.5
* Anaconda - Jupyter Notebook
* Python Libraries:
    * sklearn.
    * Pandas.
    * numpy.
    * seaborn
    * matplotlib.
    * datetime.

3.  There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart in Kaggle. This is the data that covers sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01.
   
4.   In this project, we used RandomForestRegressor and LinearRegression to predict of sales. The data have been split into training and testing with a ratio of 80:20.
   
5. The results, I.e the Analysis and prediction are given in the code.

6. I would like to give credit to ZarahShibli for Analysing The walmart store Data, Below is the Link to her Github project that inspired this project
